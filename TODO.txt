1. mem.c and swap.c both contains "Cached:".

2. monitad has an issue which make it slow for 1 second after 30/40 calls. And this way, it slows down
for 1 minute or more if it runs a long.

3. We need to count how many processor/core in the machine when start monitad. And then if number of CPU
is greater than 1, we should run monitad in multi-thread mode. Otherwise it should run all the monitoring
function in sequential mode.
